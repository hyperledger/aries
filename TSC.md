## The Duties of a TSC Member

TSC are expected to perform the following duties for the Hyperledger Aries project.

- Attend the meetings of the TSC.
  - Meetings of the TSC will generally be held during the weekly Aries Working Group calls.
  - From time to time, special meetings of the TSC Members may be called.
- Discuss issues about the Governance of the project, guided by the project's Charter, including the documented roles of TSC Members, Maintainers and Contributors.
- Vote on any issues raised about the project in line with the project's Charter.
- Discuss and vote on any issues/disputes about the projects escalated by the project's Maintainers or Contributors.
- When moved, make changes to the project's Charter is permitted by the Charter.
- Contribute to the Hyperledger Aries Project's Quarterly and Annual Report.

The duties of the TSC Members may be updated through a PR to this file that is voted on by the TSC and merged by a Maintainer of this repository.
Maintainers of this repository are obligated to handle PRs to this file as guided by the TSC.

## Becoming a TSC Member

The following steps occur in becoming a TSC member, roughly in order.

- The proposed TSC Member establishes their reputation in the Hyperledger Aries Project.
- A PR is created to update this file to add the proposed TSC to the list of active TSC Members.
- The PR is authored by an existing TSC Member or has a comment on the PR from an existing TSC Member supporting the proposal.
- The PR is authored by the proposed TSC Member or has a comment on the PR from the proposed TSC Member confirming their interest in being a TSC Member.
  - The PR or comment from the proposed TSC Member must include their
    willingness to be a long-term (more than 6 month) TSC Member.
- Once the PR and necessary comments have been received, an approval timeframe begins.
- The PR **MUST** be communicated on all appropriate communication channels, including relevant community calls, chat channels and mailing lists. Comments of support from the community are welcome.
- The PR is merged and the proposed TSC Member becomes a TSC Member if either:
  - Two weeks have passed since at least three (3) TSC Members have approved the PR or have added an comment expressing approval of the PR, OR
  - An absolute majority of TSC Members have approved the PR or have added an comment expressing approval of the PR.
- If the PR does not get the requisite PR approvals or comments expressing approval of the PR, it may be closed.

TSC membership itself does not confer repository Maintainer status -- that is a separate process.
Typically, TSC members will also be Maintainers, but the processes are independent of one another.

## Removing TSC Members

Being a TSC Member is not a status symbol or a title to be carried
indefinitely. It will occasionally be necessary and appropriate to move a
TSC Member to emeritus status. This can occur in the following situations:

- Resignation of a TSC Member.
- Violation of the Code of Conduct warranting removal.
- Inactivity.
  - A general measure of inactivity will be an extended period of not showing up to TSC Meetings, or participating in TSC discussions at Meetings or in TSC online forums.
  - Reasonable exceptions to inactivity will be granted for known long term
    leave such as parental leave and medical leave.
- Other circumstances at the discretion of the other TSC Members.

The process to move a TSC Member from active to emeritus status is comparable to the process for adding a TSC Member, outlined above. In the case of voluntary
resignation, the Pull Request can be merged following a TSC Member PR approval or approval comment. If the removal is for any other reason, the following steps **SHOULD** be followed:

- A PR is created to update this file to move the TSC Member to the list of emeritus TSC Members.
- The PR is authored by, or has a comment supporting the proposal from, an existing TSC Member or Hyperledger GitHub organization administrator.
- Once the PR and necessary comments have been received, the approval timeframe begins.
- The PR **MAY** be communicated on appropriate communication channels, including relevant community calls, chat channels and mailing lists.
- The PR is merged and the TSC Members transitions to TSC Members emeritus if:
  - The PR is approved or an approval comment added by the TSC Members to be transitioned, OR
  - Two weeks have passed since at least three (3) TSC Member PR approvals or approval comments have been recorded, OR
  - An absolute majority of TSC Members have approved the PR or added an approval comment.
- If the PR does not get the requisite PR approvals, it may be closed.

Returning to active status from emeritus status uses the same steps as adding a
new TSC Member.
